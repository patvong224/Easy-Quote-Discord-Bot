# Easy Quote Discord-Bot

What it does:
This is just files for a personally discord bot that my friends and I use. The purpose is to repeat quotes that the main users of the server say. 

How is it useful:
This bot adds more personality to the private server with my friends and adds a fun twist to what we say, this can be easily used for other servers.

How to get started:
You will first need node.js and discord.js. 
Node can be downloaded through https://nodejs.org/en/download/. 
Discord.js can be installed through the command prompt using 'npm install discord.js'.
After installing everything, it's as easy as editing the 'index.js' file. You would just change the strings and key.
